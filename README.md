# 📝 Quora Clone Backend – CRUD REST API
This is a **mini backend project** for a Quora-like post system built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**, demonstrating full **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using RESTful API principles.
It uses **EJS** for templating and **method-override** to enable PUT/PATCH and DELETE requests via HTML forms.


## 🚀 Features

*  **Create Post**
  Add new posts with a username and content using a simple HTML form.
  
*  **Read All Posts**
  View all posts on the main page with usernames and their content.
  
*  **Read Single Post**
  View details of a specific post by clicking on it.
  
*  **Edit Post**
  Update the content of any post using an edit form (supports `PATCH` requests).
  
*  **Delete Post**
  Delete any post permanently (supports `DELETE` requests).


## 🛠 Tech Stack & Tools
* **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime
* **Express.js** – Backend framework
* **EJS** – Templating engine for dynamic HTML
* **uuid** – Unique IDs for posts
* **method-override** – To simulate PATCH/DELETE methods in forms
* **HTML/CSS** – Frontend templates
* **In-memory storage** – (No database, for simplicity)


4️⃣ Open your browser and navigate to:
